My final project for The Iron Yard Front-End Engineering Boot Camp.
"Dump," is a disposal solutions app which pulls data from the Yelp Api and the city of Houston to connect users with depositories, recycling centers, donation centers, and landfills in their area.
The app serves a number of purposes. One aim is to help users dispose of items that do not qualify for regular trash or recycling pickup -- for example: Batteries, Glass, Electronics, Paints, Appliances, Electronics or objects which can be donated such as clothing and food. The user simply needs to type the object in question and Dump returns a list of centers near their current location which will take the item. Each listing includes info on hours and specific materials accepted and provides in-App directions obtained via the google maps API.
I am in the process of adding the next phase: Telling the user if an object qualifies for scheduled pickup in their area, and if so, when the pickup day is.
