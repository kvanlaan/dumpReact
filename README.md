My final project for The Iron Yard Front-End Engineering Boot Camp.
"Dump," is a disposal app which pulls data from the Yelp Api and the city of Houston to connect users with information on recycling schedules as well as depositories, donation centers, and landfills in their area. The user simply types the object in question and Dump will help them dispose of it in two ways. Firstly, the app will notify the user if an object qualifies for pickup in their area, and connect them with their specific scheduling info. Then, with the use of geolocation and an algorithm I personally designed, Dump returns a list of centers which take the item, in order of proximity to the user's current location. Furthermore, each listing includes info on hours, specific materials accepted, and other relevant information, and provides in-app directions obtained via the google maps api.

In the works: Data from the city of Madison, Wisconsin.
